 Project for the course "Introduction to Programming"

## Overview
The project is structured into 2 files. The file “functions.py” contains all functions needed for the data queries. The file “app.py” contains the construction of the data and the code for the dashboard. Running app.py generates a link, with which one can access the dashboard in the browser. 

The “style.css” file was taken from [dash-sample-apps/apps/dash-web-trader at master · plotly/dash-sample-apps · GitHub](https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps/tree/master/apps/dash-web-trader), but was edited.

The “reddit_posts.csv” file was created using the  getPushshiftData function in “functions.py” and is updated every time “app.py” is run.
